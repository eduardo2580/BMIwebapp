  "aboutNutricionText1": "Our Nutritional Plan Generator first estimates your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) â€“ the calories your body needs daily. For example, if your Estimated TDEE is 2066 calories, this becomes your Target Calories. The generator then breaks down these calories into recommended macronutrients: Protein (e.g., 140g), Fat (e.g., 57g), and Carbohydrates (e.g., 247g), to help you achieve your dietary goals.",
